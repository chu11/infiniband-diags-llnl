.TH IBLINKINFO 8 "Jan 24, 2008" "OpenIB" "OpenIB Diagnostics"

.SH NAME
iblinkinfo \- report link info for all links in the fabric

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B iblinkinfo
   [-hcdl -C <ca_name> -P <ca_port> -p -S <port_guid> -G <port_guid> -D <direct_route> \-\-load\-cache <filename>]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
iblinkinfo reports link information for each port in an IB fabric, node by node.
Optionally, iblinkinfo can do partial scans and limit its output to parts of a
fabric.

Alternately, in "check mode" iblinkinfo scans an attached IB fabric, reads the
ib fabric config file, and checks the two.  Checks performed include invalid
cabling, downed/disabled ports, invalid speed, and invalid width's.

While iblinkinfo can create it's config file from a scan of an IB fabric this
is not the intended use case.  The fabric config is intended to document the
desired cabling and properties of an IB fabric, generated from vendor cabling
documentation.  This document can then be verified against reality by
iblinkinfo -c.  For simply diffing the fabric from one run to the next both
ibnetdiscover and iblinkinfo have cache capabilities.

See \fBFILES\fR for more information on the configuration file format.

.SH OPTIONS

.PP
See infiniband-diags(8) for common options.

.PP
.TP
\fB\-S <port_guid>\fR \fB\-G <port_guid>\fR \fB\-\-port\-guid\fR
start partial scan at the port specified by <port_guid> (hex format)
.TP
\fB\-D <direct_route>\fR
start partial scan at the port specified by the direct route path.
.TP
\fB\-l\fR
Print all information for each link on one line. Default is to print a header
with the node information and then a list for each port (useful for
grep\'ing output).
.TP
\fB\-d\fR
Print only nodes which have a port in the "Down" state.
.TP
\fB\-p\fR
Print additional port settings (<LifeTime>,<HoqLife>,<VLStallCount>)
.TP
\fB\-C <ca_name>\fR    use the specified ca_name for the search.
.TP
\fB\-P <ca_port>\fR    use the specified ca_port for the search.
.TP
\fB\-R\fR (This option is obsolete and does nothing)
.TP
\fB\-\-load\-cache\fR <filename>
Load and use the cached ibnetdiscover data stored in the specified
filename.  May be useful for outputting and learning about other
fabrics or a previous state of a fabric.  Cannot be used if user
specifies a direct route path.  See
.B ibnetdiscover
for information on caching ibnetdiscover output.
.TP
\fB\-\-diff\fR <filename>
Load cached ibnetdiscover data and do a diff comparison to the current
network or another cache.  A special diff output for iblinkinfo
output will be displayed showing differences between the old and current
fabric links.  Be default, the following are compared for differences:
port connections and port state.  See
.B ibnetdiscover
for information on caching ibnetdiscover output.
.TP
\fB\-\-diffcheck\fR <key(s)>
Specify what diff checks should be done in the \fB\-\-diff\fR option above.
Comma separate multiple diff check key(s).  The available diff checks
are:\fIport\fR = port connections, \fIstate\fR = port state, \fIlid\fR = lids,
\fInodedesc\fR = node descriptions.  If \fIport\fR is specified alongside \fIlid\fR
or \fInodedesc\fR, remote port lids and node descriptions will also be compared.
.TP
\fB\-\-filterdownports\fR <filename>
Filter downports indicated in a ibnetdiscover cache.  If a port was previously
indicated as down in the specified cache, and is still down, do not output it in the
resulting output.  This option may be particularly useful for environments
where switches are not fully populated, thus much of the default iblinkinfo
info is considered unuseful.  See
.B ibnetdiscover
for information on caching ibnetdiscover output.

.TP
\fB\-\-switches\-only\fR
Show only switches in output. (does not affect "check" mode)
.TP
\fB\-\-cas\-only\fR
Show only CAs in output. (does not affect "check" mode)


.SH CHECK OPTIONS
.TP
"Check" and "generate" options apply only when XML support was enabled for the build.

.TP
\fB\-check, \-c\fR
Check links against ibfabricconf.xml config.

.TP
\fB\-config <ibfabricconf>\fR
Specify an alternate config file (default: @IBDIAG_CONFIG_PATH@/ibfabricconf.xml)

.TP
\fB\-\-downnodes <nodelist>\fR
Specify nodes which are known to be off thus indicating that links to those
nodes are known to be down.  "nodelist" is a comma separated list of node
description names.

.TP
\fB\-\-smlid <lid>\fR
Specify an smlid to verify on all active ports.

.TP
\fB\-\-addr-info <lid>\fR
Print port GUID and LID information for the ports being reported as errors.


.SH GENERATE OPTIONS

Although not the intended use case for this utility is it understood that the
generation of this config file from an existing fabric can be very useful.  The
following options allow for this.

.TP
\fB\-\-generate\-config <config>\fR
Generate a config file from a scan of the fabric.  NOTE that this config file
is somewhat generic in nature as it does not include any link parameters such
as speed or width.  Most fabrics are somewhat homogeneous in nature.  It is
intended that this config file be modified with these parameters as global
settings.

.TP
\fB\-\-ignore <regex>\fR
when generating a config skip nodes matching <regex>

.TP
\fB\-\-missing\fR
insert place holders for disconnected ports


.SH EXIT STATUS

0 on success, -1 on failure.

If check mode is used return 1 if inconsistencies are found, otherwise 0.
